music industries are for "talented" people.

i have been occasionally creating some pieces of music.

most of the time i just dream about the music, with clear melodies and tones ringing in my head.

feels really disappointing after awakening and losing every detail of the musical dream.

i try to record my dream in humming.

for dubstep like dreams, i could not really have a way for description till i get familiar with describing existing dubstep songs, possibly by making some noise.

i record the draft, my feelings and the lyrics in audio record, text. if possible i also want to paint a picture or create a video too, to better describe my dream and my idea.

i could possibly use ai to suggest similar songs, generate missing parts of the song like intro, outro, percussion.
